# SkiaSharp Demo App

This is just a simple Xamarin.Forms demonstration app. It shows how to do 
a few tasks:

 * Add the `<SKCanvasView>` to a page
 * Attach a handler to the `PaintSurface` event
 * Clear the canvas
 * Create a `SKPaint` instance
 * Draw a simple circle
 * Draw a `SKPath`
 * Draw text
